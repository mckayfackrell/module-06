# module-06 Weather Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard application allows a user to get a 5-day weather forecast for any city.

## URL and Screenshot

## Usage

When the user opens the website they are presented with a search bar that allows them to search any city.

The user types in the desired city they wish to see a 5-day forecast for and clicks the search button.

The 5-day forecast is then populated for that city which includes the following data; city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed.

The list of previously searched cities remains in the left column (which can be recalled by a single click) under the search button because the data is stored in the localStorage.
